# Decoding a text
This python code was done to decode and encode a text

## Overview
This project consists of two files:
1. A file for the basics (`main.py`).
2. A main Python script (`example.py`).

# Main.py
The scripts demonstrate fundamental Python concepts, including:
- Strings
- Integers
- Built-in functions
- Arguments
- Indexing
- Methods
- Loops and keywords

## Code Breakdown

### Strings
```python
my_Name = "Priscilla Abena Aboagye"
mySchool = "Mfantsiman Girls"
myCountry = "Ghana"
```

### Integers
```python
myAge = 19
myNumber = 14
luckyNumber = 3
```

### Built-in Functions
```python
print()
len(mySchool)
type(my_Name)
```

### Arguments
```python
print(myAge)
print(my_Name)
print(mySchool)
print(myCountry)
print(myNumber)
print(luckyNumber)
```

### Indexing
```python
print(my_Name[3])
```

### String Methods
```python
my_Name.find("r")
myCountry.capitalize()
my_Name.lower()
my_Name.upper()
my_Name.swapcase()
```

### Loops and Keywords
Python loops and conditional keywords used in iterations:
- `for`
- `while`
- `if`

# Example.py
This Python program demonstrates two encryption methods:
1. Caesar Cipher
2. Vigenere Cipher

## Overview
The program includes two main encryption functions:
- **Caesar Cipher**: This function shifts the letters of a message by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.
- **Vigenere Cipher**: A more advanced cipher that uses a keyword (key) to shift letters by different amounts depending on the corresponding letter in the key.
