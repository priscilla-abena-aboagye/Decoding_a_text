# Decoding a text
This python code was done to decode and encode a text

## Overview
This project consists of two files:
1. A file for the basics (`main.py`).
2. A main Python script (`example.py`).

### Main.py
The scripts demonstrate fundamental Python concepts, including:
- Strings
- Integers
- Built-in functions
- Arguments
- Indexing
- Methods
- Loops and keywords

## Code Breakdown

### Strings
```python
my_Name = "Priscilla Abena Aboagye"
mySchool = "Mfantsiman Girls"
myCountry = "Ghana"
```

### Integers
```python
myAge = 19
myNumber = 14
luckyNumber = 3
```

### Built-in Functions
```python
print()
len(mySchool)
type(my_Name)
```

### Arguments
```python
print(myAge)
print(my_Name)
print(mySchool)
print(myCountry)
print(myNumber)
print(luckyNumber)
```
